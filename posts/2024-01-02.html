<p>Today I spent some time exploring how to beautifully render mathematical equations and code snippets on the web. It's amazing how accessible these tools have become!</p>

<h2>Mathematical Beauty with MathJax</h2>

<p>One of the things I wanted for this journal was the ability to write mathematical equations. Using MathJax, I can now write equations inline or as display blocks.</p>

<h3>Inline Math</h3>

<p>For example, I can write about the famous equation \(E = mc^2\) right in the middle of a sentence. Or mention that the quadratic formula is \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}\).</p>

<h3>Display Math</h3>

<p>For more complex equations, I can use display mode. Here's the beautiful Euler's identity:</p>

<div class="math-block">
$$e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$$
</div>

<p>And here's the Gaussian (normal) distribution:</p>

<div class="math-block">
$$f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}\right)^2}$$
</div>

<h2>Code Snippets</h2>

<p>I can also share code snippets with proper formatting. Here's a simple Python function:</p>

<pre><code>def fibonacci(n):
    """Calculate the nth Fibonacci number."""
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

# Print first 10 Fibonacci numbers
for i in range(10):
    print(f"F({i}) = {fibonacci(i)}")
</code></pre>

<p>And here's some JavaScript:</p>

<pre><code>// A simple function to greet someone
function greet(name) {
    return `Hello, ${name}! Welcome to my daily journal.`;
}

console.log(greet('World'));
</code></pre>

<h2>Images and Visual Content</h2>

<p>The site also supports images and GIFs. This is perfect for:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Diagrams and illustrations</li>
    <li>Screenshots of interesting things</li>
    <li>Photos from daily life</li>
    <li>Animated GIFs for fun or educational purposes</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Note: To add images, just place them in an <code>images</code> folder and reference them with standard HTML <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tags.</em></p>

<h2>What I Learned</h2>

<blockquote>
    The best way to learn is to teach. The best way to understand is to explain.
</blockquote>

<p>Setting up this capability taught me:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>MathJax Integration:</strong> How to integrate MathJax CDN for LaTeX-style equation rendering</li>
    <li><strong>CSS Styling:</strong> Creating a clean, readable design that works well with different content types</li>
    <li><strong>HTML Structure:</strong> Keeping content simple and semantic</li>
    <li><strong>GitHub Pages:</strong> How straightforward it is to host static sites</li>
</ol>

<h2>Fun Math Fact</h2>

<p>Did you know? The sum of all positive integers approaches negative one-twelfth:</p>

<div class="math-block">
$$1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + \cdots = -\frac{1}{12}$$
</div>

<p>This surprising result (from Ramanujan summation) has applications in string theory and quantum physics!</p>

<h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>

<p>I'm really happy with how flexible this setup is. I can write about:</p>

<ul>
    <li>📚 Technical topics with proper equation support</li>
    <li>💭 Personal reflections with rich formatting</li>
    <li>💻 Code and programming concepts</li>
    <li>🎨 Visual content when needed</li>
</ul>

<p>The key is that it's simple enough to maintain daily, but powerful enough to express complex ideas. Perfect balance!</p>
