                    <p>
                        In <a href="2026-01-01-Applied-AI-Roadmap-Part-1.html">Part 1</a> of this series, we explored
                        how agentic systems serve as an operational layer between foundational models and business
                        outcomes. We examined patterns across industries and how these systems help companies automate
                        tasks, analyze data, and solve complex problems through orchestrated workflows.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        A common question arises: <strong>Is applied AI exclusively about building agents?</strong> The
                        answer is no. While agentic systems represent one significant opportunity, there exists another
                        equally important dimension: <strong>vertical adoption through domain-specific models</strong>.
                        This second pathway focuses on companies building and owning their own specialized AI
                        capabilities rather than relying solely on general-purpose foundation models.
                    </p>

                    <hr>

                    <h2>Agentic Systems vs. Vertical Adoption</h2>

                    <p>
                        Agentic systems excel in general-purpose domains such as mathematical reasoning, logical
                        analysis, data interpretation, and code generation. These systems function as intelligent
                        generalists, applying broad knowledge to solve common problems across various contexts.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        However, challenges emerge when companies operate in specialized verticals with unique
                        requirements. Consider a healthcare organization with proprietary datasets, compliance
                        constraints (such as HIPAA), and domain-specific workflows. In such cases, general-purpose
                        models may not suffice. Companies face three primary motivations for developing custom models:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Intellectual Property Ownership</strong> — retaining full control over the model's
                            intelligence and capabilities</li>
                        <li><strong>Regulatory Compliance</strong> — meeting industry-specific regulations that general
                            models cannot guarantee</li>
                        <li><strong>Competitive Advantage</strong> — creating differentiated capabilities that
                            competitors cannot easily replicate</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        This represents a fundamental shift in strategy: from <em>"using intelligence"</em> to
                        <em>"owning intelligence."</em> When organizations use general models like GPT or Claude, they
                        own the application logic but not the underlying intelligence. Custom models enable complete
                        ownership of the entire stack.
                    </p>

                    <hr>

                    <h2>Companies Building Domain-Specific Models</h2>

                    <p>
                        Several companies exemplify this vertical adoption approach. Let's examine concrete examples:
                    </p>

                    <h3>Voice Intelligence</h3>
                    <p>
                        Companies like Smallest AI and ElevenLabs build specialized models for voice interaction. Rather
                        than integrating third-party voice APIs, they develop proprietary models optimized for specific
                        use cases—customer service, voice agents, or real-time conversation. This vertical integration
                        allows them to:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Optimize latency for real-time applications</li>
                        <li>Reduce operational costs through efficient model design</li>
                        <li>Maintain quality control across the entire pipeline</li>
                        <li>Customize behavior for specific industry requirements</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Healthcare Decision Support</h3>
                    <p>
                        In my previous work, we developed a custom model for medical document synthesis and healthcare
                        decision support. The motivation extended beyond compliance—we needed domain expertise embedded
                        directly into the model's weights. This approach ensures that the model understands medical
                        terminology, clinical workflows, and evidence-based reasoning without requiring extensive prompt
                        engineering for each query.
                    </p>

                    <hr>

                    <h2>Applied Research vs. Fundamental Research</h2>

                    <p>
                        It is important to clarify expectations. Most organizations cannot conduct fundamental AI
                        research—the development of entirely new architectures or pre-training models from scratch. This
                        requires resources available primarily to large research laboratories and frontier AI companies.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Instead, organizations engage in <strong>applied research</strong>, which involves:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Architecture Adaptation</strong> — selecting and modifying existing architectures
                            (e.g., transformers, state-space models) for specific domains</li>
                        <li><strong>Continued Pre-training</strong> — further training foundation models on
                            domain-specific data</li>
                        <li><strong>Fine-tuning</strong> — adapting pre-trained models to specific tasks with supervised
                            or reinforcement learning</li>
                        <li><strong>Alignment Training</strong> — using techniques like Direct Preference Optimization
                            (DPO) or Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to align model behavior with desired
                            outcomes</li>
                    </ul>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>
                            Applied research requires deep understanding of architectures, training paradigms, dataset
                            preparation, and evaluation methodologies. It is not merely following tutorials—it demands
                            deliberate practice and domain expertise.
                        </p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>
                        Unlike the agentic systems work discussed in Part 1 (which emphasizes software engineering),
                        vertical adoption demands <strong>machine learning expertise</strong>. Companies need
                        professionals who understand training dynamics, can design experiments, and can iterate on model
                        architectures.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Essential Skills for Domain-Specific AI</h2>

                    <p>
                        Building and deploying domain-specific models requires a distinct skill set. Let's break down
                        the core competencies:
                    </p>

                    <h3>1. Understanding Modern Architectures</h3>
                    <p>
                        You should be familiar with:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Transformer models</strong> — the foundation of most modern language models (GPT,
                            BERT, T5)</li>
                        <li><strong>Vision-Language Models (VLMs)</strong> — architectures that process both images and
                            text</li>
                        <li><strong>State Space Models</strong> — emerging alternatives to transformers for certain
                            applications</li>
                        <li><strong>Mixture of Experts (MoE)</strong> — architectures that activate different
                            sub-networks for different inputs</li>
                        <li><strong>Specialized Encoders/Decoders</strong> — for audio, video, or other modalities</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>2. Training Paradigms</h3>
                    <p>
                        Understanding when and how to apply different training approaches:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Full Fine-tuning</strong> — updating all model parameters (requires significant
                            computational resources)</li>
                        <li><strong>Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)</strong> — techniques like LoRA or QLoRA that
                            update only a fraction of parameters</li>
                        <li><strong>Continual Pre-training</strong> — extending a foundation model's knowledge with
                            domain-specific data</li>
                        <li><strong>Alignment Training</strong> — teaching models to follow instructions and align with
                            human preferences</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>3. Data Preparation and Curation</h3>
                    <p>
                        The quality of your model depends fundamentally on your data. This includes:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Collecting relevant domain-specific datasets</li>
                        <li>Cleaning and preprocessing data appropriately</li>
                        <li>Creating high-quality training examples</li>
                        <li>Balancing datasets to avoid bias</li>
                        <li>Versioning and managing data pipelines</li>
                    </ul>

                    <hr>

                    <h2>Two Career Paths: Training vs. Optimization</h2>

                    <p>
                        The field naturally divides into two complementary specializations. Most professionals will
                        focus on one path, though some knowledge of both remains valuable.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Path 1: Training and Validation</h3>
                    <p>
                        This path focuses on:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Designing and selecting appropriate architectures</li>
                        <li>Preparing training datasets</li>
                        <li>Running experiments and comparing approaches</li>
                        <li>Evaluating model performance</li>
                        <li>Iterating on model design based on results</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Path 2: Scaling and Optimization</h3>
                    <p>
                        This path emphasizes:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>GPU optimization and efficient compute utilization</li>
                        <li>Kernel optimization for specific operations</li>
                        <li>Inference optimization (reducing latency and cost)</li>
                        <li>Distributed training across multiple machines</li>
                        <li>Model quantization and compression</li>
                    </ul>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>
                            You do not need to master both paths simultaneously. Choose one as your primary focus, then
                            expand your knowledge into the other area as needed.
                        </p>

                        Applied AI involves building systems that exhibit human-like cognitive capabilities:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Understanding</strong> — comprehending user intent, context, and nuance</li>
                        <li><strong>Reasoning</strong> — performing logical analysis and multi-step problem-solving</li>
                        <li><strong>Generation</strong> — creating coherent text, images, or other content</li>
                        <li><strong>Interaction</strong> — engaging in dialogue and adapting to user needs</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        Examples include voice agents, chatbots, document synthesis systems, and creative AI tools.
                        These systems aim to replicate or augment human intelligence for specific tasks.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Applied ML: Owning Algorithms</h3>
                    <p>
                        Applied ML focuses on developing algorithms for specific, well-defined tasks:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Prediction</strong> — forecasting demand, prices, weather, or other quantities</li>
                        <li><strong>Classification</strong> — categorizing data into predefined groups</li>
                        <li><strong>Recommendation</strong> — suggesting relevant items to users</li>
                        <li><strong>Optimization</strong> — finding optimal solutions to constrained problems</li>
                        <li><strong>Anomaly Detection</strong> — identifying unusual patterns in data</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        These systems do not require human-level intelligence. Instead, they excel at specific
                        algorithmic tasks through pattern recognition and mathematical optimization.
                    </p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>
                            Applied AI owns intelligence. Applied ML owns algorithms. Both use similar underlying
                            technologies (neural networks, transformers), but serve different purposes.
                        </p>

                    <h2>Real-World Applications of Applied ML</h2>

                    <p>
                        Let's examine concrete examples to illustrate Applied ML in practice:
                    </p>

                    <h3>Recommendation Systems</h3>
                    <p>
                        Companies like Spotify or Netflix use sophisticated neural networks to encode user preferences
                        and content features into latent spaces. These systems do not "understand" music or movies in a
                        cognitive sense—they identify statistical patterns in user behavior and content characteristics
                        to make predictions about what users might enjoy.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Quantitative Finance</h3>
                    <p>
                        Algorithmic trading systems use machine learning for alpha signal generation—identifying market
                        opportunities likely to outperform average returns. These models analyze market dynamics,
                        technical indicators, and other features to generate trading signals. They require domain
                        expertise but not human-like reasoning capabilities.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Demand Forecasting</h3>
                    <p>
                        Retail and logistics companies use time-series models (including transformer-based
                        architectures) to predict future demand. These systems analyze historical patterns, seasonality,
                        and external factors to forecast quantities. The models are highly specialized but do not
                        exhibit general intelligence.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Personal Example: Aquaculture</h3>
                    <p>
                        During my time at Captain Fresh, we used transformer models to analyze satellite imagery of
                        aquaculture ponds. The goal was to predict harvest readiness and estimate biomass availability.
                        This application combined computer vision with time-series analysis, demonstrating how modern
                        architectures can solve highly specific problems outside traditional AI domains.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Educational Resources</h2>

                    <p>
                        To build expertise in applied AI and ML, I recommend focusing on three areas:
                    </p>

                    <h3>1. Machine Learning Fundamentals</h3>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Primary Resource:</strong> Kevin Murphy's <em>Probabilistic Machine Learning</em>
                    </p>

                        frameworks, and inference techniques. It provides the mathematical foundation necessary for
                        understanding modern AI systems.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Alternative:</strong> Stanford's CS229 Machine Learning course for a more practical
                        introduction.
                    </p>

                    <h3>2. Modern Deep Learning Architectures</h3>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Primary Resource:</strong> Simon Prince's <em>Understanding Deep Learning</em>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This open-source book includes practical notebooks and covers modern architectures:
                        transformers, diffusion models, autoencoders, energy-based models, and graph neural networks. It
                        bridges theory and practice effectively.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Supplementary:</strong> Stanford's CS25 (Transformers United) and CMU's Advanced Deep
                        Learning courses provide additional perspectives and cutting-edge research.
                    </p>

                    <h3>3. High-Performance Machine Learning (Optional)</h3>
                    <p>
                        If you choose the optimization path, study GPU programming, distributed training frameworks, and
                        inference optimization techniques. Resources include:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Stanford's CS149 (Parallel Computing)</li>
                        <li>NVIDIA's CUDA programming guides</li>
                        <li>PyTorch and JAX optimization documentation</li>
                    </ul>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>
                            Avoid relying solely on YouTube tutorials or interview preparation content. These resources
                            rarely teach problem-first thinking or provide the depth necessary for applied work. Focus
                            on comprehensive textbooks and university courses that build fundamental understanding.
                        </p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <hr>

                    <h2>Choosing Your Specialization</h2>

                    <p>
                        To avoid overwhelming yourself, consider specializing along several dimensions:
                    </p>

                    <h3>By Modality</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Text-only models (language understanding, generation)</li>
                        <li>Vision-Language models (multimodal understanding)</li>
                        <li>Audio models (speech, music, sound)</li>
                        <li>Video models (temporal understanding, generation)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>By Industry Vertical</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Healthcare (medical imaging, clinical decision support)</li>
                        <li>Finance (trading, risk assessment, fraud detection)</li>
                        <li>Life Sciences (drug discovery, protein prediction)</li>
                        <li>Creative Industries (music, art, design)</li>
                        <li>Enterprise Software (productivity, automation)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>By Application Type</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Interactive systems (agents, chatbots)</li>
                        <li>Analytical systems (forecasting, classification)</li>
                        <li>Generative systems (content creation, synthesis)</li>
                        <li>Optimization systems (resource allocation, planning)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        Start with one combination (e.g., "text models for healthcare applications") and build deep
                        expertise before expanding to adjacent areas.

                    <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Applied AI is not limited to agents</strong> — vertical adoption through
                            domain-specific models represents a major opportunity</li>
                        <li><strong>Companies build custom models for three reasons</strong> — IP ownership, compliance
                            requirements, and competitive advantage</li>
                        <li><strong>Applied research differs from fundamental research</strong> — most work involves
                            adapting architectures rather than inventing new ones</li>
                        <li><strong>Two career paths exist</strong> — training/validation specialists and
                            scaling/optimization engineers</li>
                        <li><strong>Applied AI vs. Applied ML</strong> — the former builds intelligence, the latter
                            builds algorithms for specific tasks</li>
                        <li><strong>Focus on fundamentals</strong> — study Kevin Murphy's and Simon Prince's textbooks
                            rather than tutorial content</li>
                        <li><strong>PEFT techniques are important</strong> — LoRA and QLoRA enable efficient fine-tuning
                            with limited resources</li>
                        <li><strong>Specialize strategically</strong> — choose a modality, industry, and application
                            type to focus your learning</li>
                        <li><strong>Applied ML remains essential</strong> — forecasting, recommendations, and
                            optimization still require specialized algorithms</li>
                        <li><strong>Build problem-solving skills</strong> — prioritize deep understanding over interview
                            preparation</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        The field offers multiple entry points depending on your interests and background. Whether you
                        focus on training new models, optimizing existing ones, building agents, or developing
                        specialized algorithms, the fundamental requirement remains the same: deep understanding of
                        underlying principles combined with practical problem-solving skills.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In future installments of this series, we will explore additional dimensions of the applied AI
                        landscape. Stay tuned for further guidance on navigating this rapidly evolving field.
